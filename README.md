# Probability, Stochastic Processes & Simulation in Python
## Preface

In the age of artificial intelligence, robotics, intelligent systems and machine learning, which are increasingly taking up space in practically all areas; and since the emergence of intelligent applications on which most of the major IT players rely; in this great technological whirlwind, we ask the computer scientist to know, create and innovate more and more. However, the development of the necessary skills to master these recent technologies cannot be achieved without having the essential bases in probability, which is one of their fundamental pillars. Mastering the foundations of this pillar has thus become essential.
It is with this in mind that we are proposing this book on probabilities, stochastic processes and simulation, and the challenge of which is to simplify the basic concepts by the example and by the practice.
This book is intended primarily for computer scientists, but can obviously be used by anyone wishing to learn elementary concepts in probability with their practical side in order to subsequently be able to tackle other more advanced subjects such as machine learning and  artificial intelligence.\\

The particularity of this work lies in the large number of offered examples, exercises and codes  in order to facilitate the assimilation of the various presented concepts. The codes are written in the Python programming language and allow the reader to expose the most common and efficient APIs and libraries for probability, stochastic processes and simulation.
Python being one of the most popular programming languages that beginners can learn quickly because of the simplicity of its syntax and the readability of its code. It is versatile and its packages are among the most mature of computer languages.

\noindent The first part of this work is devoted to the bases of probabilities: in the first chapter the definitions of the most elementary concepts in probabilities are presented.
Chapter 2 focuses on the notion of discrete and continuous random variables by presenting the most well-known probability distributions.
In the chapters of the second part we deal respectively with stochastic processes, discrete and continuous Markov chains, as well as their applications to queuing systems.
The last part is devoted to simulation. We first present the random numbers and  variables generators, then the different modules offered by Python for the simulation of more elaborated systems.
Throughout the book, the reader can find a plethora of Python code. The written codes show how to implement the different concepts on machine using the available libraries  in Python, at the same time, they contribute to their improvement with new classes and functionalities.
Finally, and to help the reader better understand the usefulness of theoretical concepts, we have added several applications with their implementations at the end of the chapters.
